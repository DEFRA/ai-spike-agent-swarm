    "# Managed Agent Swarm - Policy Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores a **managed agent swarm** pattern where a central orchestrator coordinates multiple specialist AI agents to collaboratively analyze farming policy documents. Unlike autonomous swarms where agents self-organize, or round-robin approaches where agents take predetermined turns, the managed swarm uses an intelligent orchestrator to dynamically direct the conversation based on the emerging discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea being tested is whether an LLM-powered orchestrator can effectively facilitate a productive multi-agent dialogue by:\n",
    "- Deciding which specialist to engage at each step\n",
    "- Creating connections between agents' observations\n",
    "- Directing follow-up questions that build on prior findings\n",
    "- Knowing when sufficient insights have been gathered to synthesize a final report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case: Policy Document Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "We apply this pattern to analyze UK farming policy documents across three dimensions:\n",
    "- **Critique Agent**: Analyzes how the document is written (clarity, structure, tone, accessibility)\n",
    "- **Gap Analysis Agent**: Identifies missing information and coverage gaps\n",
    "- **Ambiguity Agent**: Detects unclear language and vague requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator facilitates a group discussion between these specialists, encouraging them to respond to each other's findings rather than working in isolation. This collaborative approach aims to surface insights that might be missed by sequential or independent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Message History**: All agents see the full conversation, enabling them to reference and build on each other's observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Tool Selection**: The orchestrator chooses which specialist to engage based on the current state of the discussion, not a fixed sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human-in-the-Loop Handoff**: When the orchestrator determines sufficient analysis has been completed, it hands off to a report writer agent. A human approval step allows for feedback or acceptance before final report generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage Limits**: Token and tool call limits prevent runaway execution while encouraging focused, efficient analysis.\n",

    "The orchestrator is the \"swarm manager\" with several key responsibilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool-based coordination**: Uses three tool functions (`ask_critique_agent`, `ask_gap_analysis_agent`, `ask_ambiguity_agent`) to engage specialists\n",
    "2. **Dynamic decision-making**: Chooses which specialist to call based on conversation state, not a fixed pattern\n",
    "3. **Dialogue facilitation**: System prompt instructs it to create connections between agents' observations\n",
    "4. **Handoff decision**: Determines when sufficient analysis has occurred and triggers report generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The orchestrator's output type is set to `handoff_to_report_writer`, making handoff the natural conclusion of its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specialist Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Each specialist agent has a focused role with a system prompt designed to encourage collaborative dialogue:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critique Agent**: Analyzes document writing quality - clarity, structure, tone, and accessibility. Prompted to reference other agents' observations when responding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gap Analysis Agent**: Identifies missing information and coverage gaps. Encouraged to connect gaps to issues raised by other agents.\n",

    "- Tools to query the source policy document\n",

    "### Tool Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tool function (`ask_*_agent`) handles the interaction with a specialist:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logs the question** being asked (for visibility during execution)\n",
    "2. **Calls the specialist agent** with the source policy and question, passing shared message history\n",
    "3. **Records the interaction** in the shared message history as a request/response pair\n",
    "4. **Returns formatted response** to the orchestrator\n",
